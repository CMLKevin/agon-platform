## Commission Logic Summary

The commission system works as follows:

1. **When auction ends:** Highest bidder's Agon is held in escrow
2. **When winner confirms delivery:**
   - Calculate commission: `total × 0.05`
   - Calculate net payment: `total × 0.95`
   - Find first admin user: `SELECT id FROM users WHERE is_admin = 1 LIMIT 1`
   - Transfer net payment to seller
   - Transfer commission to admin
   - Remove total from winner's escrow
   - Mark auction as completed
   - Create two separate transaction records
   - Log activity for all three parties

---

## Edge Cases Handled

✓ **Seller is also an admin:** Commission still goes to the first admin user (by ID), not necessarily the seller  
✓ **Multiple admins exist:** Commission goes to the admin with the lowest ID  
✓ **Precise decimal calculations:** 5% of 101.00 = 5.05 Agon (no rounding errors)  
✓ **Separate transaction types:** `auction` and `commission` are distinct for easy tracking  
✓ **Complete audit trail:** All three parties have activity logs

---

## Conclusion

The 5% auction commission feature has been **successfully implemented and thoroughly tested**. All financial calculations are correct, database state is consistent, transactions are properly recorded, and the admin panel accurately displays all commission-related data.

**Status: PRODUCTION READY** ✅
