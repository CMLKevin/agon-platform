# How to Add Prediction Markets - Quick Guide

## üéØ Two Ways to Add Markets

2. Scroll to "Available Markets from Polymarket"
3. Browse the list of markets
4. Click "Add" button on any market
5. Done! ‚úÖ

### Method 2: Manual Entry (Always Works)
If the API is down or you want a specific market:

#### Step 1: Find the Market on Polymarket.com
1. Visit https://polymarket.com
2. Browse to find a market you want
3. Click on the market

#### Step 2: Get the Market ID

2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for API calls to `gamma-api.polymarket.com`
5. Click on one of these requests
6. In the response, find `"condition_id": "0x..."`
7. Copy the entire condition_id (starts with `0x`)

**Even Easier Method (Page Source):**
1. Press `Ctrl+U` (or `Cmd+Option+U` on Mac) to view page source
2. Search for `condition_id`
3. Copy the value that looks like: `0x123abc456def...`

#### Step 3: Add to Your Platform
1. Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Prediction Markets
2. Find "Manually Add Market" section
3. Click "Show" if it's hidden
4. Paste the condition_id in the input field

7. Done! ‚úÖ

## üí° Tips

### Best Markets to Add
- High volume markets (more traders = more liquidity)
- Binary YES/NO markets (easier for users to understand)
- Clear resolution criteria (avoid ambiguous questions)
- Reasonable end dates (not too far in future)

### Markets to Avoid
- Very low volume (<$100)
- Markets with unclear questions
- Markets that have already closed
- Multi-outcome markets (only binary YES/NO supported)

### After Adding Markets
1. **Test Trading**: Try placing a small order yourself first
2. **Check Prices**: Make sure prices update every 15 seconds
3. **Monitor**: Check server logs for quote sync errors
4. **Promote**: Share the new market with your users!
