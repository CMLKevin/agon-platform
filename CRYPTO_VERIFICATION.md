# Crypto Trading Logic Verification

## P&L Calculation Verification

### Long Position Example
**Scenario: Price goes UP (profit)**
- Entry Price: $50,000
- Current Price: $55,000 (10% gain)
- Margin: 100 Ⱥ
- Leverage: 5x
- Commission Rate: 2.78% (at 5x leverage)
- Commission Amount: 2.78 Ⱥ
- Net Margin: 97.22 Ⱥ
- Position Value: 97.22 × 5 = 486.10 Ⱥ worth of BTC

**P&L Calculation:**
```
Price Difference = $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000
Price Change % = $5,000 / $50,000 = 0.1 (10%)
P&L = 0.1 × 97.22 × 5 = 48.61 Ⱥ profit ✓

Total Return = 97.22 + 48.61 = 145.83 Ⱥ
User receives: 145.83 Ⱥ (45.83 Ⱥ profit after initial 100 Ⱥ)
```

**Scenario: Price goes DOWN (loss)**
- Entry Price: $50,000
- Current Price: $45,000 (10% loss)
- Same parameters as above

**P&L Calculation:**
```
Price Difference = $45,000 - $50,000 = -$5,000
Price Change % = -$5,000 / $50,000 = -0.1 (-10%)
P&L = -0.1 × 97.22 × 5 = -48.61 Ⱥ loss

Total Return = 97.22 - 48.61 = 48.61 Ⱥ
User receives: 48.61 Ⱥ (51.39 Ⱥ loss from initial 100 Ⱥ)
```

### Short Position Example
**Scenario: Price goes DOWN (profit)**
- Entry Price: $50,000
- Current Price: $45,000 (10% drop)
- Margin: 100 Ⱥ
- Leverage: 5x
- Net Margin: 97.22 Ⱥ

**P&L Calculation:**
```
Price Difference = $50,000 - $45,000 = $5,000
Price Change % = $5,000 / $50,000 = 0.1 (10%)
P&L = 0.1 × 97.22 × 5 = 48.61 Ⱥ profit ✓

Total Return = 97.22 + 48.61 = 145.83 Ⱥ
User receives: 145.83 Ⱥ (45.83 Ⱥ profit)
```

**Scenario: Price goes UP (loss)**
- Entry Price: $50,000
- Current Price: $55,000 (10% rise)

**P&L Calculation:**
```
Price Difference = $50,000 - $55,000 = -$5,000
Price Change % = -$5,000 / $50,000 = -0.1 (-10%)
P&L = -0.1 × 97.22 × 5 = -48.61 Ⱥ loss

Total Return = 97.22 - 48.61 = 48.61 Ⱥ
User receives: 48.61 Ⱥ (51.39 Ⱥ loss)
```

## Liquidation Logic Verification

### Long Position Liquidation
**Formula:** `Liquidation Price = Entry Price × (1 - (1/leverage) × 0.9)`

**Example with 10x leverage:**
- Entry Price: $50,000
- Liquidation Price = $50,000 × (1 - 0.1 × 0.9) = $50,000 × 0.91 = $45,500

**At Liquidation ($45,500):**
```
Price Drop = 9%
P&L = -0.09 × margin × 10 = -0.9 × margin
Total Value = margin - 0.9 × margin = 0.1 × margin (10% remaining)
```
This provides a 10% safety buffer before complete liquidation ✓

### Short Position Liquidation
**Formula:** `Liquidation Price = Entry Price × (1 + (1/leverage) × 0.9)`

**Example with 10x leverage:**
- Entry Price: $50,000
- Liquidation Price = $50,000 × (1 + 0.1 × 0.9) = $50,000 × 1.09 = $54,500

**At Liquidation ($54,500):**
```
Price Rise = 9%
P&L = -0.09 × margin × 10 = -0.9 × margin
Total Value = margin - 0.9 × margin = 0.1 × margin (10% remaining)
```
This provides a 10% safety buffer ✓

## Commission Structure Verification

**Formula:** `Commission = 1% + ((leverage - 1) / 9) × 4%`

| Leverage | Commission | Calculation |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1x | 1.00% | 1% + (0/9) × 4% = 1.00% ✓ |
| 2x | 1.44% | 1% + (1/9) × 4% = 1.44% ✓ |
| 5x | 2.78% | 1% + (4/9) × 4% = 2.78% ✓ |
| 10x | 5.00% | 1% + (9/9) × 4% = 5.00% ✓ |

## Edge Cases & Safety Checks

### 1. Complete Loss Protection
```javascript
const totalReturn = margin + realizedPnl;
const finalReturn = Math.max(0, totalReturn); // Can't go below 0
```
✓ User can lose at most their margin, never go negative

### 2. Infinite/NaN Protection
```javascript
if (leverageNum < 1 || leverageNum > 10 || !isFinite(leverageNum)) {
  return error;
}
if (marginAgonNum <= 0 || !isFinite(marginAgonNum)) {
  return error;
}
```
✓ Validates against NaN and Infinity

### 3. Balance Check
```javascript
if (!wallet || parseFloat(wallet.agon) < marginAgonNum) {
  throw new Error('Insufficient Agon balance');
}
```
✓ Prevents overdraft

### 4. Transaction Atomicity
```javascript
await db.tx(async (t) => {
  // All operations in transaction
});
```
✓ All database operations are atomic

### 5. Price Validation
```javascript
if (!currentPrice || !currentPrice.price) {
  throw new Error('Failed to fetch current price');
}
```
✓ Validates price data exists

- Efficient queries with FILTER WHERE

## Conclusion

All trading logic verified ✓
- Long positions: Profit when price rises
- Short positions: Profit when price falls
