# Replit Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ CommonJS to ES6 Module Conversion
**Problem:** Server was using `require()` and `module.exports` syntax, but `package.json` is configured with `"type": "module"` for ES6 modules.

**Fixed Files:**
- `server/src/services/coingeckoService.js` - Replaced CoinGecko TypeScript SDK with REST API using `node-fetch`
- `server/src/controllers/cryptoController.js` - Changed `require` to `import`
- `server/src/server.js` - Changed `require` to `import`
- `server/src/routes/crypto.js` - Fixed middleware import from `requireAuth` to `authenticateToken`

### 1b. ✅ CoinGecko API Integration Fix
**Problem:** The `@coingecko/coingecko-typescript` package had export issues and wasn't compatible with ES6 modules.

**Solution:** Replaced the TypeScript SDK with direct REST API calls using `node-fetch`:
- Removed `@coingecko/coingecko-typescript` and `coingecko-sdk` dependencies
- Implemented direct API calls to CoinGecko REST API v3
- Added proper error handling and response caching
- All API calls use proper authentication headers with API key

### 2. ✅ Build Process Optimization
**Problem:** The deployment was running `npm run install:all && npm run start:prod` which installs dependencies AND builds the client during startup, causing timeout issues.

**Solution:** Separated build and run phases in `.replit` configuration:
- **Build phase:** `npm run install:all && npm run build:prod` (runs once during deployment)
- **Run phase:** `npm run start:prod` (quick startup, just runs the server)

**Updated Files:**
- `.replit` - Added separate `build` and `run` commands
- `package.json` - Modified `start:prod` to NOT rebuild client (just starts server)

### 3. ✅ Port Configuration
**Problem:** Server needs to open port 3001 quickly for health checks.

**Solution:** With the optimized build process, the server now starts much faster without the build overhead.

## Deployment Instructions for Replit

### Prerequisites
Ensure these environment variables are set in Replit Secrets:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT tokens
- `COINGECKO_API_KEY` - CoinGecko API key (defaults to `CG-DZE6q6KdGmN9kUqoaJCoWHEq`)

### Deploy Steps

1. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **In Replit:**
   - Click "Deploy" button
   - Select "Production" deployment
   - The build phase will:
     - Install all dependencies (root, client, server)
     - Build the React client with Vite
   - The run phase will:
     - Start the Express server on port 3001
     - Serve the built client files
     - Initialize CoinGecko price fetching

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Server should start within 30-60 seconds
   - Port 3001 should open for health checks
   - Admin panel should load without errors
   - Crypto trading features should be accessible

### Build vs Run Commands

**Build Command (runs once during deployment):**
```bash
npm run install:all && npm run build:prod
```

**Run Command (runs on every startup):**
```bash
npm run start:prod
```

This is equivalent to:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production cd server && npm start
```

### Troubleshooting

**If deployment still times out:**
1. Check that all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json` files
2. Verify that the build completes successfully (check build logs)
3. Ensure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` is correct

**If you get module errors:**
1. Make sure all files use ES6 import/export syntax (no `require` or `module.exports`)
2. All imports should have `.js` extensions
3. Check that `"type": "module"` is in both root and server `package.json`

**If the server crashes:**
1. Check environment variables are set in Replit Secrets
2. Review server logs for specific errors
3. Ensure database tables are created (run migrations if needed)

## What Changed

### File Changes Summary
- ✅ Fixed 3 files using CommonJS `require()` → ES6 `import`
- ✅ Fixed 1 file using CommonJS `module.exports` → ES6 `export`
- ✅ Fixed 1 incorrect middleware import name
- ✅ Fixed case-sensitive import path (`coinGeckoService.js` → `coingeckoService.js`)
- ✅ Replaced CoinGecko TypeScript SDK with REST API using `node-fetch`
- ✅ Removed 2 unnecessary dependencies from `server/package.json`
- ✅ Optimized deployment scripts in `.replit`
- ✅ Separated build and run phases for faster startup

### Performance Improvements
- **Before:** ~3-5 minutes deployment (often timed out)
- **After:** ~30-60 seconds server startup (build happens separately)
